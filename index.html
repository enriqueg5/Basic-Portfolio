                Enrique Garduno was born in a country with beautiful beaches, architecture, and most importantly food. Beacuse who doesn't love food right? Enrique was born in Mexico City, the land that saw the birth of tacos al pastor, quesadillas, pozole and many more delicacies. At the age of 19 Enrique ventured into a distant land mainly known for its breakfast tacos, tex-mex food, live-musicp, and overall hipster vibe. That is right, Enrique ventured into the beautiful city of Austin, Texas; leaving the country he dearly loved to seek a higher level of education.
